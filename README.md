# Cost_Of_Living: WORK IN PROGRESS

Summary: This project started as a web dev project but I see potential here. The basic idea is to create a simple website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery & React. This is my first attempt and I would tag this as a work-in-progress.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
My Two Cents: I picked cost of living as my focus subject because of the amount of data that is easily accessible. To keep this project light, I used a simple Excel sheet containing a small data set about US costs. This is an intro to web dev that i put together in 2019. Here is what I have learnt so far:

--> Wireframes will save you time and a few headaches. It's hard to visualize an entire project in one sitting especially for a newbie. Wireframes are great blue prints. I normally like to use a simple pen/paper approach to my wireframes. I don't need them to look pretty, I just want to put my thoughts on paper....If I know what something will look like, I can plan my design and my code better.

--> Is web dev an art? Still trying to figure this part out. Some of the feedback I have received include: avoid "busy" backgrounds, simple is always better & bright color doesn't always mean awesome. CSS might look simple but it requires some practice.

--> React works like a charm and feels just like writing HTML. React has the least abstractions but it does have a learing curve so spend sometime learning it. Of course, this is the hottest thing right now but just like with everything else.. keep learning other things.

--> I can't be the only one that thinks this but libraries are great when they work.. especially if you know or understand them. For any newbies, be prepared for failure. It took me a while to get how google maps works even when a lot of people suggested that I use leaflet because it's easier to learn. I chose to stick with it. I got it to work it's not as fancy as other examples I have seen but now that I know the basics, I can build on that.
